Feature List I Chose:
● Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter
commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program

● Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and
use it in your program

● Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes
them to a text file

● Create 3 or more unit tests for your application



Choose at least 4 items on the Features List below

● Other features can be added to this list with mentor or staff permission, but we want to
